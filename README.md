# Period-Buddy

## Inspiration
Coming from India,  "period" is taboo for most people, even for the educated ones. It was always in our mind to take some steps towards making it a socially and culturally acceptable topic. Also, it is hard to find apps related to periods in native Indian languages.

## What it does
The basic aim of our app is to sooth those who have to go through periods. 
It has features like 
- Finding your period buddies i.e. your friends who have their periods with you
- Know how to support someone during their periods, could be your significant other, best friends or anyone you want

## How we built it
We used Firebase for backend and native android and react (web) as front end.

## Challenges we ran into
- Getting a female perspective 
- Getting trustable resources regarding periods
- Integrating firebase with both android and react

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Creating a complete solution with backend, android, and web.
- Created something to give back to the community 

## What we learned
- As men, it's impossible to understand what periods feel like.
- How to integrate firebase with frontend and use firestore database

## What's next for Period Buddy
- First to complete the frontend and backend integration
- Add support for our native languages like Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, Bengali, Panjabi, etc
